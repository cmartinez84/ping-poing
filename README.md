## Program Specs
-will only accept positive numbers. all other characters will yield a prompt reminds the user to only enter a whole number greater than zero
  ex: an input of "Hello" will yield a prompt message asking the user to enter only a whole number
-despite warning agains using decimals, it will still round down any numbers ending in decimals, for ex: an input of "1.4" will automatically round down to "1",
-will count up to the number inputted
  Ex: an input of 2 will return 1 2
-any input that is a multiple of 3 will return "ping" instead of the number:
  ex: an input of 6 will return "ping";
-any input that is a multple of 5 will return "pong" instead of that number:
  ex: an input of 100 will return "pong";
-any input that is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple  5 will return, and will only return, "ping pong";
-results will be displayed on screen in ping pong balls, with a little animation on hover,
-after all results are displayed, a play again button will eliminate the number from the balls and present the user with the input display again.
